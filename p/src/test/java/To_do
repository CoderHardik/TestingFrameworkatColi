1. (Lecture 135):
For API test cases. Create new package and for each page of class - put all associated test cases in that page. \
That way, when you execute you can segarigate.

- Same thing to be done for selenium test cases so it is easy to spot each of them
 
 
 2. For on boarding testing do jdbc test for following
 
 - Check guids for user in mongo and udm
 - check opps in mongo and udm/prime and compare them
 
 3. Set Global Properties file with URL, username etc. No need to have hashmap with username and guid. Can have properties file
 
 4. Create UI test for predictive forecast - where it checks date. if it is from past then fail.
